[How to get the sample dataset](https://github.com/suriyadeepan/datasets)

`mode = train`

## Start training

`python execute.py`

## Testing
You can stop the training anytime, the trained model will be saved in easybot/working_dir/. 
Change seq2seq.ini to switch to the testing mode, then start execute.py：

`python execute.py`

## All the code for serve mode is in easybot/webui/
- Main app: 

`python webui/app.py`

- Startup/Shutdown:

`sh webui/startup.sh`
`sh webui/shutdown.sh`

- Background runing:

`sh webui/startup.sh`

- App Daemon:

`sh webui/app-daemon.sh`
